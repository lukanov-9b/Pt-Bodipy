# Machine learning-aided algorithm to predict absorption maximum wavelength and cytotoxicity of platinum-containing BODIPYs

1. This repository contains all necessary files (including data sets) to realize algorithm in your own computer. Firstly, you need to install modules discribed in `requirements.txt` file. If you use `pip` installer, you will have to do this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. When all necessary modules are installed, you can run notebook file `Notebook_For_Testing_Models.ipynb`.
